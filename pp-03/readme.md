1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14N0u0k00kH02yT00qb01fa0t8A
Your Rationale: I decided to go with a grayscale.  This is because the website should be straightforward displaying the technological advances of the next generation of gaming consoles.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55q0u0klLORaIX9gPT8qmJMwqDr
Your Rationale: I chose to stay around the purple/pink/red/orange spectrum as they reflect the colors of flowers.  Spring is associated with the blooming of flowers and trees and easter.  I decided to lighten/soften the colors to be more inviting and friendly.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33X120klEy-bKPnhfGnq5urtHo+
Your Rationale: I tried making the colors as simple as possible and wanted to go with a red, green, and blue theme.  I decided to go with this specific palette as it is soft and inviting.  The simple colors give it an elementary school theme.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=a0z2K0knC0000h900YiBE++mxrQ
Your Rationale:This custom palette is a combination of black, grey, orange, and green.  I feel like the palette for a cybersecurity course should aspects of power, mystery, determination.  The black expresses power and mystery.  Orange expresses determination.  And green is a bonus.  Green can be used as a strong contrast to black.
